# cs598-dlh-team-17
Code for CS 598: Deep Learning for Healthcare final project at UIUC. 

Our code can be found in the `DL4H_Team_17.ipynb` file. To run the code, users need to create a conda environment using the dependencies listed in the original KeyClass paper, which can be found [here](https://github.com/autonlab/KeyClass). 

You then need to download the MIMIC-III dataset and edit the paths in the notebook to point to the required files from MIMIC-III. Then, the notebook will create training and test datasets, which are then passed off to the KeyClass code, which has also been included in this repository for convenience.
